rawgl:
	autogenerated typesafe low-level wrapping of OpenGL API
	maybe unify glUniform*, glVertexAttrib* and the like based on parameter type

glitter:
    RAII!
	high-level object representation of OpenGL state (context, buffer objects, texture units...)
	complete functionality without user access to raw OpenGL API
	clean stack operations (with statements for binding and unbinding, enabling and disabling etc.)
	context generation and switching
	transparent CUDA and OpenCL interoperability
	think about lifetime of objects passed to the GL
    glBindBuffer and glBindBufferRange/glBindBufferBase interfer with each other!
    slicing to bind buffer ranges, set vertex attribute pointers (offset + stride), write texture sub images etc.

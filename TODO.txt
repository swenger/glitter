RAII!
high-level object representation of OpenGL state (context, buffer objects, texture units...)
complete functionality without user access to raw OpenGL API
clean stack operations (with statements for binding and unbinding, enabling and disabling etc.)
context generation and switching
transparent CUDA and OpenCL interoperability
think about lifetime of objects passed to the GL
glBindBuffer and glBindBufferRange/glBindBufferBase interfer with each other!
slicing to bind buffer ranges, set vertex attribute pointers (offset + stride), write texture sub images etc.
